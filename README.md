# Third Eye for the Blind - Arduino Nano Project


## Description
The "Third Eye for the Blind" project is a hardware solution designed to assist visually impaired individuals in detecting obstacles in their surroundings. This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, and Arduino Nano microcontroller board to provide real-time alerts about nearby large objects.

## Features
- Detects large objects using an ultrasonic sensor.
- Emits audio alerts via a buzzer to warn visually impaired users of obstacles.
- Real-time obstacle detection and alert system.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Nano microcontroller board.
- Ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement.
- Buzzer for audio alerts.

## Installation and Usage
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor and buzzer to the Arduino Nano following the circuit diagram (provided in the repository).
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (code) provided in the repository onto the Arduino Nano.
3. Power on the system and observe the ultrasonic sensor's measurements and buzzer's alerts.
